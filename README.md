# Tour of Go
- Following the Tour of Go interactive tutorial to learn Go
- I'm planning to do this in a series of commits, one for each section
- I want to use Go for backend development and scripting.

- The old tutorial I used was out of date, and I never went deep with it. So relearning is the best course of action to take.

## Thoughts After Finishing
- It was a great tutorial.
- Learned a lot of things that will be useful even outside Golang.
- I'm looking forward to using Go in personal projects.
